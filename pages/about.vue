            <p class="zen-body mb-4">
              ZenMind was born from a simple belief: everyone deserves access to the transformative power of yoga and mindfulness. Founded in 2020, our studio has grown into a thriving community of wellness seekers.
            </p>
            <p class="zen-body mb-4">
              What started as a small neighborhood studio has evolved into a comprehensive wellness center, offering diverse practices that honor both ancient wisdom and modern needs.
            </p>
            <p class="zen-body mb-6">
              Our journey continues to be guided by the principles of compassion, inclusivity, and authentic practice.
